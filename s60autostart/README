S60AutoStart v1.6

User-selectable autostart for Qt apps on Symbian/S60 devices

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project will enable Qt for Symbian applications to be started 
automatically during a device bootup process.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE:

- Extract the zip into your Qt project folder (that contains your .pro file)

- Add following line to the end of your .pro file:

include(s60autostart/s60autostart.pri)

- Define following variables in your .pro file:

  TARGET.UID3
    - Specifies unique ID to use for the target symbian application
    - See qmake variable reference for more information
    
  s60launcher.UID3
    - Specifies unique ID to use for the native launcher application
    - Same format as TARGET.UID3, value must be different
    
(Optional):

  CONFIG += enable-autostart
    - If defined, autostart is enabled by default after installation

- Finally, rerun qmake, then build normally

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:

After a successful build, the sis file needs to be signed against a trusted
certificate, as required by the s60 startup list manager. Autostart 
application cannot be installed using a self-signed sis package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

S60AutoStart uses a native Symbian executable that's included in the main 
application sis file and added to the startup list. This executable checks
for the presence of c:\system\data\<AppName>.ini file, and launches the main
application if it exists.

It's easy to provide a setup UI for turning autostart on/off in the main
application using the provided helper functions:

#ifdef Q_OS_SYMBIAN

#include "s60autostart.h"

bool autostart = S60AutoStart::IsAutoStartEnabled();

// toggle autostart
S60AutoStart::SetAutoStart( !autostart );

#endif // Q_OS_SYMBIAN

The launcher passes a command line parameter to the application. This makes it 
possible to determine whether the application was launched automatically or by
the user. Parse the command line arguments in main() for "autostart" string
(without quotes), or simply check if argc > 1.


Qt Quick Support

Autostart settings are also available for QML. In the source file that contains
the main() entrypoint, include qtquick-autostart.h and call qmlInitAutoStart():

#include "qtquick-autostart.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
		QApplication app(argc, argv);
		qmlInitAutoStart();
		...
		
qmlInitAutoStart() function (or a macro, actually) must be called before 
attempting to load any .qml files. It will register a new element called
AutoStart, available by importing com.nokia.autostart.symbian:

import QtQuick 1.1
import com.nokia.autostart.symbian 1.0

...

AutoStart { id: autostart }

After this, autostart.enabled (bool) is initialized with the current 
autostart setting and can be turned on/off.

autostart.launchType is a read-only string containing one of two values:

"normal"	- Application was launched by the user
"auto"		- Application was launched automatically
